# User-Created JavaScript Snippets

All of the snippets in this folder have been created by users of mabl. Feel free to copy and paste any of the examples seen here to use in your own mabl testing! 
 

## Getting Started

Create a JavaScript snippet in your mabl code editor. Assure that the code properly runs then copy and paste that code into a .js file. Use this file when uploading your own snippets for a pull request and if the snippet is properly formatted and is unique, we will approve the pull request so that your snippet can join the other user-created examples!
